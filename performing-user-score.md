We have been cast as “users” by tech companies, rendered passive and reactive, expected to click “accept” on their terms of service that willfully disregard questions of privacy, ethics, and justice. 

But the underestimation of the user is our opportunity to hack, exploit, and subvert this role. We can reject the false premise of a generic hypothetical user. The user has an identity. The user exists within a particular social and cultural context. The user exists.

We can ask: How do the technologies we use choreograph our actions, provoke us to perform, and open spaces for improvisation? What are the user gestures that define new paradigms for interacting with systems?

This is a score for performing user.
